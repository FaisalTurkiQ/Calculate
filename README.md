# Calculator Application README

## Description
This is a simple calculator application written in Java using Swing, a graphical user interface (GUI) library for Java. The application provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Addition: Enter the first number, click the "+" button, enter the second number, and then click the "=" button to see the result.
- Subtraction: Enter the first number, click the "-" button, enter the second number, and then click the "=" button to see the result.
- Multiplication: Enter the first number, click the "*" button, enter the second number, and then click the "=" button to see the result.
- Division: Enter the first number, click the "/" button, enter the second number, and then click the "=" button to see the result.
- Clear: Click the "C" button to clear the input field.
- Continuous calculations: After performing a calculation, the result is stored as the first number, allowing for continuous calculations.

## How to Use
1. Run the application by executing the `main` method in the `Calculate` class.
2. A GUI window titled "My Calculator" will appear on the screen.
3. The calculator has a text field at the top where you can see and input numbers and results.
4. Below the text field, you'll find the numeric buttons from 0 to 9 and the arithmetic buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. To perform a calculation:
   - Enter the first number in the text field.
   - Click one of the arithmetic buttons (+, -, *, /) to set the operation.
   - Enter the second number in the text field.
   - Click the "=" button to see the result of the calculation.
6. To perform another calculation using the result as the first number, simply choose the next operation and enter the second number.

## Note
- The calculator handles integer arithmetic only. Decimals and floating-point numbers are not supported.
- Division by zero is not handled in this version of the calculator, so be cautious when performing division operations.

## Future Improvements
This calculator application is a basic implementation and can be enhanced in various ways, including:
- Adding support for decimal numbers and floating-point arithmetic.
- Implementing more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root, trigonometric functions).
- Adding keyboard input support to enable users to input numbers and perform calculations using the keyboard.
- Improving the user interface with better styling and layout.
